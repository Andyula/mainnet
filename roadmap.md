## GAME roadmap 1.0
The GAME Product Roadmap 1.0 reflects feedback from core GAME stakeholders (ICO holders, GAME Foundation, GAME community members, validators, delegators).

The roadmap provides guidelines to help GAME stakeholders understand how the GAME product will evolve in the future.

As for the specific schedule in the roadmap, the more immediate the date, the more specific it is, and the further in the future, the less precise it becomes. The roadmap itself will be updated as it progresses to help GAME stakeholders better understand the status of the product.
